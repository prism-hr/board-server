    Dear ${recipient},
</p>

<p>
    We're sorry to inform you that there has been a problem collecting one of your subscription payments.
</p>

<p>
    We expect that this is nothing to worry about, in all likelihood your payment card has expired.
</p>

<p>
    As a valued customer, we're providing you with a grace period to rectify the problem. The grace period ends on:
    ${suspendedExpiryDeadline}. After this time your department will be locked until you provide a new payment method.
</p>

<p>
    Login now to rectify the problem. All you need is a credit or debit card for your monthly payments.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
    See you on the inside!
</p>

<p>
    Yours,<br/>
    The support team
